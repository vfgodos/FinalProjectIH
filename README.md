# Cryptocurrencies Analysis & Fraud prediction on ETH transactions

## Project Description

The main goal of this project is to study the behaviour of cryptocurrencies and compare them with other actives and between themselves. Finally, I will use machine learning to try to predict fraud on transactions which is an important problem to improve. 

## Motivation

Due to their high evolution in last years, cryptocurrencies are a topic in which many people is interested nowadays so having a more technical view on them is important to try to understand their behaviour and see future oportunities in this world.

## Dataset 

You can found the dataset in FILES folder as "ETH_trans.csv". You can also download it in the following link: https://www.kaggle.com/danielrabayev/ethereum-transactions-fraud-detection/data?select=transaction_dataset.csv 

The dataset contains 9840 rows (1 for each transaction) and 51 columns (different attributes about the transaction). The target is the column called 'Flag' which tell us what transactions are fraudulent.

## How to understand and work with the project

Opening the notebook you will observe that the project is auto-guided and there are explanations about almost all the steps I'm doing so it will be easy to understand what I'm doing in each moment.
Almost all the Graphics are followed by a resume of what you are seeing.
